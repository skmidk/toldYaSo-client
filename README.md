# What this app does
This app is a forum type setting where people can discuss predictions. From sports to politics, it is a place for people to post their ideas and predictions. As well as engage in discussion with other users about these topics.

It utilizes a front end client to work with a server and database to process client requests, store data, and process input.

# Technologies used

This client application utilizes bootstrap, html, css, jquery, and ajax.

# unsolved problems
 I would like to figure out how to use css stylings on the text generated by the handlebars template.

 I was unable to get a clean update feature. I would also like the ability to add friends on there, and have a message inbox for users as well. I also would like to add a comment feature!

# planning
I drew out some wireframes to give me an idea of how I wanted the site to look, as well as functionality.

Some of it ended up being too complicated with the reduced timeframe I had to work on the project thanks to power outages, so I ended up going fairly simple on it. My first day I spent time making sure all my curl scripts worked in the api, adding in schemas for posts and comments, and checking to make sure they all worked properly.

Once that was done, I went ahead over to the client application and fleshed out a super basic structure with all the input fields and buttons I needed for testing to ensure things worked appropriately. Once that finished, I then moved on to dealing with making the site look better with html and css.
